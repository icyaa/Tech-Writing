## [Section 1: User Guide ‚Äì Login with Single Sign-On (SSO)](#section-1-user-guide--login-with-single-sign-on-sso)

### üîé [**What is SSO?**](#-what-is-sso)

---

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is a login method that allows users to using **one account** (for example, a company email account) to access multiple applications at once.

With SSO, the login process becomes **simpler, faster, and more secure** because there is no need to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

### üìù [How to Log In Using SSO](#-how-to-log-in-using-sso)

---

Follow these steps to log in to the application:

1. Open the application login page.
The login form will appear with fields for **Username/Email** and **Password**.

2. **Enter SSO account credentials.**
    - Type the registered **company email address** or **SSO username**.
    - Enter the **password**.
    - Use the üëÅÔ∏è (*eye*) icon to verify that the typed password is correct.
    - (Optional) Check **Remember Me** when logging in from a personal device.
    - If the password is forgotten, click **Forgot Password** (see [Forgot Password](#forgot-password))

3. Click the `Login` button.
4. **Verify identity with OTP (One-Time Password).**
    
    After credentials are verified, the system sends an **OTP code** to the registered email address.
    
    ![Group 632575.png](Group_632575.png)
    
    - A notification will appear confirming that the **OTP has been sent**.

        > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
        > 
        > - When this option is enabled, the system recognizes the device and network for 30 days, so OTP input is not required during that period
        > - When disabled, OTP will be **requested every time** a login occurs, even on the same network.
5. Login Complete
    
    To confirm that the login process is successful, the system will automatically redirect to the **dashboard** page. Check the displayed **username** to ensure that the correct account is logged in.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Tips When Using SSO

---

To maintain account security when using Single Sign-On (SSO), pay attention to the following:

<details>
  <summary>Manage Passwords Safely</summary>

- **Never** share the account or password with others.  
- **Change** passwords periodically (3-6 months) to reduce misuse risk.  

![image-20251002-091943.png](image-20251002-091943.png)

1. Open the **Change Password** menu.  
2. Enter the current password in the **Old Password** field.  
3. Enter a new password in the **New Password** field. Use a **strong password** (minimum 8 characters combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). Avoid reusing the old password.  
4. Re-type the new password in the **Re-type Password** field. Use the **üëÅ (eye)** icon to verify.  
5. Complete the **Captcha** verification.  
6. Click **Update Password**.  

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Secure the Device</summary>

- Avoid logging in from **public or shared devices** without logging out afterward.  
- Enable **Remember Me** only on personal devices.  
- Use **Trust this device for 30 days** only on personal devices.  
- Regularly check **Linked Devices** by following these steps:  

![image-20251002-092032.png](image-20251002-092032.png)

1. Open the **Linked Device** menu.  
2. If an unknown or unauthorized device is listed, click **REMOVE** to revoke access.  

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</summary>

MFA adds an extra security layer by requiring additional verification beyond passwords.  

![image-20251002-092104.png](image-20251002-092104.png)

1. Open the **MFA** menu on the dashboard.  
2. Choose an additional verification method (**Email** or **Google Authenticator App**) using the checkbox.  
3. Click **Save Changes** to activate MFA.

## [**Section 2: API Reference ‚Äì SplitReservation**](#section-2-api-reference--splitreservation)


### [Overview](#overview)

---

`SplitReservation` allows users to **split one reservation containing multiple rate plans** into separate reservations. Afterward, if a guest books multiple rate plans under a single reservation but needs to manage, update, or cancel them separately, this API can be used to split the reservation.

**Example:**

- A booking includes two rate plans (e.g., ‚ÄúBreakfast Included‚Äù and ‚ÄúRoom Only‚Äù).
- The system can split them into two separate reservations for better management of pricing, payment, or room assignment.

### [Authentication](#authentication)

---

Every request to this API **must include a valid authorization token (Bearer Token)** in the header. The token confirms that the user is authenticated and authorized to access the data.

**Header Example:**

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Without a valid token, the system will denies access (error **401 Unauthorized**).
